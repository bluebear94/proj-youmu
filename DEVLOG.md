Replaced the existing set that keeps primitive objects to encompass
all renderables and used a TreeMap instead to enable drawing based on
render priority. Yep, now you can have more than 101 render priorities!
Positions of primitives also are not always absolute anymore.

I also made system scripts have a function to display the pause menu
and the end menu.

This will be a long, long journey.
